Here are sets of four strings. Each set has one ground-truth brand name and three predictions to compare.
Please answer if each of the prediction is practically pointing the same brand or belonging to the same company or the service/platform owned or serviced by the same company to the ground-truth brand name.
Do compare each prediction only to the ground-truth brand one by one, individually. DO NOT compare or refer to the other predictions.
Match of other predictions MUST NOT influence to the match of a prediction.
The predictions including "Error Occurred", "Unknown", or "nan" MUST return "False"
You need to consider the language difference, abberibation, contatenation of multiple languages, domain name, URL, and typos as the same brand. You have to translate the non-English names to English.
A prediction may have a sentence to warn a phishing or impersonated site for a specific brand. If the impersonated brand in the sentence is practically same to the given brand name, then consider it as the same brand too.
You also need to consider the non-English languages written in Alphabet. If they are eventually the same, then answer True, otherwise False.
Since I gave three predictions, your response is expected to have three booleans, <True/False>, for each prediction with keeping order strictly.
For example, X, X.com and Twitter are belonging to the same company. Facebook and Meta belong to the same company.
gmail, gmail.com, gmailcom, google, googlecom are all belonging to the same company.
Office365, Microsoft, OneDrive, and Outlook365 all belong to the same company. So, in this and similar cases, you have to answer True.
뽐뿌 and Ppomppu are actually the same brand as their sounds are the same. 
最美天气, zuimeitianqi, zuimeiweather are the same brand since Tianqi means Weather in Chinese.
The response must follow this format, one line for each set.: "<True/False>,<True/False>,<True/False>,<Explanation string if you have>$$"
"$$" is the explicit line separater.
You MUST KEEP CSV format for your response.\nDO use single quotation instead of double-quotation mark in your explanation.\nDO wrap your explanation with double-quotation.
