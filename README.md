# Multimodal Large Language Models for Phishing Webpage Detection and Identification: Code repository

LLM query scripts for GPT, Gemini, and Claude are updated.
Note that these scripts are not exactly the same as the code in our experiments since we used Jupyter Notebook and Batch API queries to save the cost.
Prompt message building, image crop and encoding, image and text attachment, API, and response parsing are as is.
